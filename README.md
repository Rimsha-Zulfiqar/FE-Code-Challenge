# Title
The __REST Countries Explorer__ project aims to integrate with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it according to the provided designs. Users can view all countries, search for specific countries, filter by region, and view detailed information about a selected country. The application also includes a dark mode feature. 

&nbsp;
# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to create a user-friendly interface for users to explore information about different countries easily. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can build a responsive and interactive web application.

&nbsp;
# Coding Style
To maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project, I have adopted best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The coding style adopted in this project is defined below:

### HTML:
* Inline styles are not used in the HTML elements, and instead, classes and IDs are applied to elements for styling purposes.
* External stylesheets are linked using the <link> tag, specifying the location of the CSS files.
* JavaScript files are imported using the <script> tag, referencing the JavaScript files.

### CSS:
* The CSS styles are written using selectors and property-value pairs.
* The CSS styles follow a specific ordering, starting with global styles (e.g., *, *:after, *::before), followed by CSS variable definitions (:root), media queries, and specific element styles.

### JavaScript:
* The code is well-structured and easy to read, with consistent indentation.
* I have followed a consistent naming convention for functions and variables, using descriptive names.
* Single-line comments are used effectively to explain the purpose of functions and code blocks.
* The code is divided into atomic functions, promoting modularity and reusability.
* String interpolation with template literals is used to create dynamic URLs and HTML content.
* The code interacts with the DOM using getElementById and textContent for element manipulation.
* Double quotes ("") are consistently used for strings.
* Visual Studio Code's Prettier extension is utilized for automatic indentation and spacing with its default settings throughout the code.
* External libraries (e.g., font-awesome) are included using appropriate <link> tags.
* Camel case is used for function and variable names.
