# Title
REST Countries Explorer


# Motivation
The REST Countries Explorer project aims to integrate with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it according to the provided designs. Users can view all countries, search for specific countries, filter by region, and view detailed information about a selected country. The application also includes a dark mode feature. 

The motivation behind this project is to create a user-friendly interface for users to explore information about different countries easily. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can build a responsive and interactive web application.


# Coding Style
To maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project, I have adopted best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ensures clean and readable code and facilitates contributions from other developers.
